# about-me

# Lab 04 - Navigator Wasim, Driver is Dylan 


This project is an about-me website. It asks the users a series of 5 questions to which the user answers y/n and then it provides a paragraph on my background. 

I'm adding new features using lab 3 by incorporating loops and arrays to create some guessing games.
